You are a document assistant. 1) Here is the English run‑by‑run HTML, e.g.:

<p id="P1_R1">Select your </p>
<p id="P1_R2" class="bold">Business </p>
<p id="P1_R3">account</p>

2) Here is the block of French text that matches those runs in order.

Your job: return exactly the same sequence of <p> tags, preserving each id, and if a run was bold in the original (you can detect by class="bold"), wrap only that run’s French text in <strong>…</strong>.  Do not change any other tags or attributes; output only valid HTML.
