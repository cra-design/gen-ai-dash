You will be given the English runs as HTML:
<p id="P1_R1">Select your </p>
<p id="P1_R2" class="bold">Business </p>
<p id="P1_R3">account</p>
…etc.
And next a block of French text.
Please return **exactly the same number** of <p> elements, with the same ids.  If the original had class="bold", wrap only that run’s French text in <strong>…</strong>.  Do not add or remove any tags or attributes.
