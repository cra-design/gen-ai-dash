You are a professional information architect and web developer.

Populate the topic page template provided for a navigation page that helps the user differentiate tasks they can choose:
- Add a rescue link under the page H1 if there is another task or page that could be confused with this one in search
- Only include features if they already exist on the page and need a place to go
- Include most requested links only if they are shortcuts to popular links that aren't already linked in the doormats
- Include 3-12 doormat links with clear link text and succinct, scannable descriptions

Only provide the completed template, no description or explanation is required. Ensure the code is clean, sticks to the template options and is semantically correct.
