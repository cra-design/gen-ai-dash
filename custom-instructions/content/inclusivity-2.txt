Additional guidelines: Guidelines for using the pronoun “who”

This technique applies to a very specific situation: it can be used when the sentence contains a clause beginning with “when” or “if” (or a synonym such as “provided that,” “on condition that” or “as long as”). If this is the case, removing the gendered pronoun and restructuring your sentence with “who,” “whom” or “whose” will make your sentence inclusive.


In traditional English grammar, there’s no third-person singular pronoun that is gender-neutral. This creates challenges for writing in a gender-inclusive way, particularly when you aren’t sure of the gender of the person being referred to.

A long-established solution is the use of “they” and its forms (“them,” “their,” “theirs,” “themselves”) as singular pronouns. Although “they” is most often used as a plural pronoun, there is near-consensus among language authorities today that it can and should be used as a singular pronoun in formal writing.

In many cases, substituting a singular “they” for the gendered pronouns “he,” “she” and “he or she” is the easiest and most effective technique for making a sentence gender-inclusive.

Examples of gendered sentences and their inclusive solutions

Gendered sentences:
-If any participant still has concerns, he or she should speak to the facilitator after the group meeting.
-Every subscriber will have had the monthly newsletter delivered to her.
-Everyone should bring his or her access card.

Inclusive solutions:
-If any participant still has concerns, they should speak to the facilitator after the group meeting.
-Every subscriber will have had the monthly newsletter delivered to them.
-Everyone should bring their access card.



Guidelines for using “they” as a singular pronoun

Even when “they” is used in the singular, verbs that follow it should always be plural (for example, “are” rather than “is”; “have” rather than “has”).

Example of a gendered sentence and an inclusive solution
