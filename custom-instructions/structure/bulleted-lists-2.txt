 Numbered lists

To draft a high-quality source document:

-organize your ideas
-arrange your ideas from most to least important to the task
-test your order with a representative audience
-do not use the passive voice
-it is important to use the right words
-use only short sentences and paragraphs

Lists:
Avoid having more than 1 sentence in a single list item
Don't end the list items with any punctuation
When list items are grammatically independent of each other or follow a heading, capitalize the first letter of each list item.

Example of punctuation in independent list items:

*Most requested*

-Financing your new business
-Financing for innovation
-Find a loan for your small business
-Canada job grants for employers

When the meaning of list items depends on a lead-in phrase, don't capitalize the first letter of each unless it's a proper name.

Example of punctuation in interdependent list items preceded by a colon:
Representatives can be:

-citizenship or immigration consultants
-lawyers
-other representatives
